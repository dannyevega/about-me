			<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>I'm a Software QA Engineer for Apple testing software across multiple platforms. I'm an outgoing person who enjoys beautifully designed websites, sneakers, music, a good cup of coffee, and good energy. I went to a programming bootcamp in San Francisco and I'm currently focusing on my design and front-end skills.</p>

				<p>Although I don't get to see them as often as I'd like to, my family is important to me and they're always on my mind. I also value self-sufficiency and non-complacency. I am obviously satisfied when I achieve a goal but I'm always pushing for something more. I'm self-motivated in accomplishing new goals and continuing to learn.</p>

			<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
				<p>I'm from Southern California - all over SoCal, really. I was born in Anaheim, Ca and lived in LA and the Inland Empire. After finishing high school, I moved to Irvine in Orange County to attend UCI. Currently, I'm living in Oakland, Ca in the east bay and I love it!</p>

		<h1>More About Me</h1>

			<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
				<p>I like to stay active so working out and running are very important to me. I love listening to music and staying up to date with technology and sneakers! I also love craft beer and trying new foods, which Oakland has plenty to offer.</p>

			<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
				<p>My dream job would to be a front-end engineer for Snapchat and be able to live closer to my family!</p>

			<h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
				<p>I honestly listen to everything - no joke. I know it's common for people to give that generic response but in my case, I really do! I get bored of stuff quickly so I'm always changing what I'm listening to from day to day and week to week. Last week, I went to a Pentagram show in the city and this week, I'm listening to The Smiths, Jamie xx and Nas - take that for diversity.</p>
